### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Chinese middle school student in [Ningbo Zhenhai Jiaochuan Academy](http://www.nbjc.net.cn).

I used to be a OIer, but I'm not now because I want to code whatever I want.

I am also in the group [*UniCoder*](https://github.com/UniCoderGroup).

My nickname `_Kerman` comes from [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com).

Website: https://kermanx.github.io

### What's going on

We are developing a project called `ucon`.

It is a Node.js super framework for I/O in terminals.

ðŸ‘‰ See it [here](https://github.com/UniCoderGroup/ucon).

And `RayChess` is a game invited by us that can both be played on paper and computer.

ðŸ‘‰ See it [here](https://github.com/UniCoderGroup/RayChess).

> _Kerman is *async*
